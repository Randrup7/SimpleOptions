# SimpleOptions

In this repository, I upload the files - .h files, .cpp files, and build settings - I use to follow the book 
"C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing 2nd Edition" by Mark S. Joshi.

The main.cpp calls the OptionMC function that calculates the value of a stock option with Monte Carlo simulation.

The OptionMC function is flexible as it utilises classes that handle modifications and easy extensions of payoffs, term structure in volatility,
term structure in rates, randon number generation and more.
